<p>
  <span itemprop="performer">Two-Day Suitcase</span> will be back at
  <a href="http://www.monkeynestcoffee.com/">Monkey Nest Coffee</a>
  on Burnet Rd near North Loop Blvd.
  Come drink hot coffee, eat warm pastries, and listen to cool music.
</p>
<p>
  Our friend Titos will play starting at about 7, and we should start at about 8:30.
  This will be our first show since Stephanie moved away.
  We'll have Tyler playing some guitar, some bass, and Matt moving around the instruments a bit.
  It should be interesting!
